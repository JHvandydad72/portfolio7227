      <div class="container"> <p>I am a athlete, husband, father, friend, entrepreneur, and a forever student. In 1993 I accepted a scholarship to Vanderbilt University to play SEC football. I was fortunate enough to play a great deal during my time in college, but was unable to make it to the next level due to injuries and politics. Earning a great degree from an even better university allowed me to open a number of profitable businesses that have provided me with a very comfortable life. I got married in 2006 to a lovely woman who was kind enough to give birth to identical
        twin boys. These boys have taught me a great deal about humility and patience that have carried over into every aspect of my life. Without my family I would not be the man who I am today.</p>
